\frametitle {Batch Stata}Instead of running Stata interactively, you may submit individual jobs in batch mode. In batch mode Stata executes your do-file entirely behind the scenes and creates a log file to keep track of execution. Batch mode uses a license only while Stata is executing and immediately relinquishes that license once execution completes. Batch mode is ideal for running do-files that take a long time but don't need to be actively monitored, such as do-files that automate large data set creation tasks or perform complex and time-consuming estimation routines.

    To run Stata in batch mode open the terminal window and enter at the command line:
    \begin{lstlisting}
qbatch stata filepath/yourdofile.do
    \end{lstlisting}
