# Trainings

This repository contains various trainings I put together as an RA at the Boston Fed. It contains 4 different training modules: Stata, LaTeX, exporting Stata tables and figures, and archives (a naive version control system I wrote long ago). I have not tested whether all of the relevant code will/run compile. Filepaths may need to be updated and/or packages installed. 


## Stata

Self-explanatory

## LaTeX

Also self-explanatory

## Exporting Stata tables and figures

Covers and provides examples of the following Stata commands: `tabout`, `esttab`/`estout`, `graph export`. 

## Archives

This is a primitive and naive version control system I built that runs every night and creates a time-stamped copy of all files that have been edited that day. There is probably no reason to use this on any system that can use git, which is basically every system, so there is probably no reason to use it, period.
