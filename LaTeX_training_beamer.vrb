        \item \lst= ! Extra alignment tab has been changed to \cr = --- You specified the wrong number of columns in a tabular environment
        \item \lst= ! File ended while scanning use of \@writefile.=
              \lst= <inserted text> \par ... \begin{ document} = --- Delete the .aux file in the directory where your .tex file is saved. This sometimes occurs after compilation failed on the previous attempt.
    \end{itemize}
